# Change List

## 2023-12-06
Upgrade to Scala 3.3.1

- the `Proof` class has been temporarily unsealed, till [lampepfl/dotty#19031](https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/issues/19031) / [epfl-lara/lisa#190](https://github.com/epfl-lara/lisa/issues/190) is fixed
- minor fixes to address compilation errors, mostly involving explicitly specifying types or implicits in some places.

## 2023-12-02
Creation of the present Change Liste, going back to October 2023

## 2023-12-02
Small improvement to Tableau tactics. It now uses sa weight-base heuristic for picking substitution and performs better.

## 2023-12-01
- Rename some FOL classes using the word "Atomics". For example, "SchematicVarOrPredLabel" --> "SchematicAtomicLabel". This does not change any functionality.
- Improved the logic in the front's FOL. Labels are no more contravariant in their type argument; Vars and constants are no longer extending `Label[Seq[Term] |-> Term]`. Apply paterns on Variables, Constants, Terms and Formulas should be cleaner and simpler. Some traits gained type parameters.
- Removed the match type for `T\*\*\*N`, which was used to obtain function application with arbitrary but fixed number of parameters given by N. Instead, `T\*\*N` is now an opaque type for `Seq[Term]`. Function application with `N` arguments is obtained through extension methods (one for each N, not one for each implementation of (T ** N) |-> S). That's a bit less general, but more flexible and possibly more efficient.
- Generally refactored the Common.scala file, ensuring uniformity across definitions. Uses less top-notch, scala-specific features and should be a bit more stable and easier to understand.

## 2023-11-27
Improvements and bug fix for the Tableau tactic.
- Occur check in unification in the tableau prover made it impossible to solve formulas such as $ \forall x. D(x) \land \neg D(f(x)) $.
Now variables in positive literals are renamed before unification, and mapped back after.
- The order of dependence of variables between each other is now tracked, so that when a substitution is decided, the outermost variable is instantiated first.
- New test cases that rely on these behaviours.

## 2023-11-24
Reafactor and reorganize files:
- Root project moved to lisa-sets
- Removed unused legacy files and tests
- Put all automation tools in the same place (lisa-sets/automation)
- Generally flatten folder structure, when possible

- Clean some files and imports
## 2023-11-15
- Added references to publications.
- Formatted the README file generally
- Fixed grammar or spelling errors
- Make instructions a bit more explicit

## 2023-11-15
- Added a tool to serialize kernel proofs. Theorems can be serialized to binary files and loaded back on later run.
- Test suite for serialization.
- On personal machine, running everything up to Recursion.scala takes 19s instead of 24s.
- Complete documentation of WithTheorems.scala
- Fixed an indexing bug in `ShrinkProof.flattenProof`

## 2023-11-8
- Fix typo in the Zermelo axioms in the manual.
- Pretty printing of front formulas, with infix. Printing should essentially always be valid code that can be copied back to a lisa file.
- Fix and improve extractor paterns of function and predicate symbols.
- It is now possible to return an `InvalidProofTactic` result inside a `TacticSubproof`. This was not possible because it is a non-local return, but some inlining makes it possible.
- Fix an unsoundness error in kernel proof checker related to steps with multiple premises.


## 2023-10-30
Implement a tableau based tactic for first order logic.
It can be used via `by Tableau`. It replaced lengthier proof scripts in most of the Quantifier.scala proofs.
It should be complete, and is not super optimized but does contains some important optimizations.
Also contains a set of dedicated tests.

## 2023-10-05
Big update to the manual. It now has a "Quick Guide" section explaining how to use LISA. Also contains general corrections and clean and uniform framing for code, with support for unicode in listings.
