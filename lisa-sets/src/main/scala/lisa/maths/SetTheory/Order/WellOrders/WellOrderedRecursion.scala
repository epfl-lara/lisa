  /**
    * The proof is divided into 2 parts: uniqueness and existence.
    *
    * Uniqueness ([[uniqueness]]): follows from well-foundedness of
    * `(A, <)`, from a minimal counterexample to `G1(x) = G2(x)`.
    *
    * Existence ([[existence]]):
    *
    * 1. ([[recursion]])
    *    We first construct a unique approximation `G_x` with domain `A_<x`
    *    for all `x ∈ A`. Namely, we show that
    *
    *      `∀x ∈ A. ∃!G_x. ∀y < x. G_x(y) = F(y, G_x ↾ initialSegment(y, A, <))`
    *
    *    We show unique existence by well-ordered induction: given that there exists
    *    unique approximations `G_y` for all `y < x`, we construct an approximation
    *    `G_x` until `x`, and show that it is unique ([[recursionStep]]).
    *
    *    The approximation `G_x` is constructed as follows ([[recursionStepExistence]]):
    *
    *      Sucessor case ([[successorCase]]):
    *       If `x` has a predecessor `p`, set `G_x = G_p ∪ {(p, F(p, G_p))}`.
    *       Hence `G_x` is an extension of `G_p` with domain `dom(G_x) = A_<p ∪
    *       {p} = A_<x`.
    *
    *      Limit case ([[limitCase]]):
    *       If `x` has no predecessors (i.e. `x` is limit), set `G_x = ⋃{G_y | y
    *       < x}`. `G_x` is a function by virtue of the fact that any two
    *       approximations `G_y` and `G_z` are coherent on the intersection of
    *       their domains ([[coherence]]).
    *
    *    The uniqueness proof for `G_x` is similar to the uniqueness proof above
    *    ([[recursionStepUniqueness]]).
    *
    * 2. ([[existence]])
    *    To define the function over `A`, we take `G = ⋃{G_x | x ∈ A}`, and we show
    *    that it is a function, in a similar fashion as in 1.b (using [[coherence]]).
    *    If there is a maximal element `m ∈ A`, we take `G' = G ∪ {(m, F(m, G))}` instead.
